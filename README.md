## About this project

The idea of this project is build an information sharing mechanism that has been used on a large scale around the world, a news portal.
In the future the idea is to allow modeling of the layout and content of the system itself

### PS:
Here is a big market behind that context. Currently, information is very valuable and the way we share it allows us to shape an entire society.

The project will be started in parts defined in the issues of the repository
and i will be very happy if any idea contained in this project can help you to build your own business and even happier if you find something that i can improve my development as a programmer
